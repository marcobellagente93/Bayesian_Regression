# Variational Inference Bayesian Neural Networks

Bayesian techniques can be combined with Deep Learning, resulting in powerful tools able to capture aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

The method presented was first developed in [arXiv:1703.04977](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04977.pdf), and later used in particle physics applications in [arxiv:2104.04543](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04543.pdf)

## Notebooks

We provide a few example notebook to illustrate the technique.
